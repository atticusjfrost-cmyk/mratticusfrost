    <p>-	Field is covered in snow
-	Accepting the change
-	The memory is faulty, the flowers shift between dead and alive
-	Different tree now lines the streets…
It is now winter and snow fills the fields. The cold how long frozen the morning dew over, bending all the blades of grass and the arms of trees. The wildflowers are no longer here; a different flower now lines the fields. They exist only in some small corner of this memory-hard drive. There they are bright as I remember. I can pick them. Even then though, it is only partial. The impression of a ghost.
I look down and see my hands are still stained. Pink and purple. Yellow and white. The snow too, it stained, creating forked paths which seem to travel on further than the horizon. More than that, they’ve stained my head and they’ve stained my mind and they’ve stained my heart.
